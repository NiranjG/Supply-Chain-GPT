# Inventory Management Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for inventory management across all warehouses to ensure optimal stock levels, minimize carrying costs, and prevent stockouts.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all SKUs managed across warehouses WH-001, WH-002, and WH-003.

## 3. Inventory Classification (ABC Analysis)

### Class A Items
- Represent 20% of SKUs but 80% of inventory value
- Require weekly review cycles
- Safety stock: 2 weeks of average demand
- Reorder frequency: Weekly

### Class B Items
- Represent 30% of SKUs and 15% of inventory value
- Require bi-weekly review cycles
- Safety stock: 3 weeks of average demand
- Reorder frequency: Bi-weekly

### Class C Items
- Represent 50% of SKUs and 5% of inventory value
- Require monthly review cycles
- Safety stock: 4 weeks of average demand
- Reorder frequency: Monthly

## 4. Reorder Point Calculation

The reorder point (ROP) is calculated as:
ROP = (Average Daily Demand × Lead Time) + Safety Stock

Example for SKU-12345:
- Average Daily Demand: 100 units
- Lead Time: 7 days
- Safety Stock: 200 units
- ROP = (100 × 7) + 200 = 900 units

## 5. Safety Stock Guidelines

Safety stock levels should account for:
- Demand variability (coefficient of variation)
- Lead time variability
- Desired service level (default: 95%)

Formula: Safety Stock = Z × σd × √L
Where:
- Z = Z-score for service level (1.65 for 95%)
- σd = Standard deviation of daily demand
- L = Lead time in days

## 6. Service Level Targets

| Category | Service Level | Max Stockout Days/Year |
|----------|--------------|------------------------|
| Critical | 99% | 3.65 |
| High | 97% | 10.95 |
| Standard | 95% | 18.25 |
| Low | 90% | 36.5 |

## 7. Warehouse-Specific Guidelines

### WH-001 (Main Distribution Center)
- Primary hub for all Class A items
- 24-hour receiving capability
- Maximum capacity: 50,000 pallet positions

### WH-002 (Regional East)
- Serves eastern region customers
- Lead time from WH-001: 3 days
- Maximum capacity: 20,000 pallet positions

### WH-003 (Regional West)
- Serves western region customers
- Lead time from WH-001: 5 days
- Maximum capacity: 25,000 pallet positions

## 8. Cycle Counting Schedule

- Class A items: Count weekly
- Class B items: Count monthly
- Class C items: Count quarterly

Variance threshold for investigation: 2% of item value

## 9. Review and Updates

This policy shall be reviewed quarterly and updated as needed to reflect:
- Changes in demand patterns
- New product introductions
- Supplier lead time changes
- Capacity constraints
